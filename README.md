##### Maybe a ten.

### This is not just a simple Client to Client through Server but... IS CLIENT TO CLIENT THROUGH SERVER CRYPTED BY RSA. 
### Everytime the server accepts a connection with a client it provides to generate the public and the private keys and send them to the client. The server saves only the public client's key.
### The user has to login and in case he doesn't have an account he can create it (email, useraname, password) and the data will be saved in a file.txt. Once he has logged in he will find four option:
- private chat --> select user to talk with --> chat and have fun.
- public chat --> chat and have fun with everyone.
- change settings --> change username/change password/change email.
- quit --> what you expect it does, create a blackhole?
